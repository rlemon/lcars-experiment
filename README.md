# LCARS experiment  

I am experimenting to see if I can copy this lcars interface, and in doing so create a stable enough minimal set of css rules to make any lcars interface.  

### example interface  
![lcars example](/lcars-example.jpg)  

There isn't really else much to this project. If I am successful other projects will spawn from this.
